## Installation

```
npm install react-flow-renderer
```

## Development

Before you start you need to install the React Flow dependencies via `npm install` and the ones of the examples `cd example && npm install`.

If you want to contribute or develop custom features the easiest way is to start the dev server:

```sh
npm start
```

and the example app via:

```sh
cd example && npm start 
```

The example app serves the content of the `example` folder and watches changes inside the `src` folder. The examples are using the source of the `src` folder.
